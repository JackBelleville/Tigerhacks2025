How to play:
Use your robot hands to move the hologram ball through the course of oncoming obstacles as you travel through space. You cannot use the controllers to pick up the ball directly, so you might need to get creative!

How to run the game:
- clone the repository
- connect a metaquest through meta link (or another xr device through similar software)
- build and run the project using your vr headset

Unity Version Required:
- Unity 2022.3.6f1

note: you cannot build the project directly onto the headset, so you will need to be plugged into the computer to play. This won't be much of an issue though, because this game is meant to be played while seated!
